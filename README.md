## General info
The project aims to demonstrate how the technological development of batteries can
impact the aeronautical area, in particular, electric aviation. One of the biggest problems that
prevent the replacement of conventional aeroplanes (which use combustion powertrain
systems) with electric aeroplanes (electric powertrain systems) is the low energy density of
the current lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the low flight autonomy of the aircraft and the
high recharge time.

In addition, considering the 2030 Agenda, it will be assessed whether, with the
transition to the electric model, there will be a beneficial change for the preservation of nature
and a better quality of life for society. All of this, within the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals.

Through research and data gathering regarding new battery technologies and the use of
simulation software, it will be possible to analyze and compare their effects, to assess
whether, with the progress of the technological evolution of batteries, there will be a
movement of substitution conventional aircraft by electric ones, the same effect being seen
today with land vehicles.

Keywords: Electric aviation. Batteries. Simulation. Sustainable development.

## Acknoledgement

Special thanks to Professor Osmar Ogashawara for believing in me and accepting being my professor adviser and Professor Jorge Henrique Bidinotto for accepting being my professor co-advisor.

Also I would like to acknowledge Murilo Gallani, Geovana Neves, Francisco Palazzo Neto, Felipe Odaguil and Diego Morais for helping me with my project, showing me tools, providing me with all the information that I needed and leading me to awesome people who could add a lot to my knowledge in relation to the aeronautics area.

Likewise, I would like to thanks Tiago Gonzalez Fein, Gabriel Wagner Paulin Carvalho and Davi Koschelny Guarniere for being my real friends since high school and Alicia Rossybel Cruz Márquez, Надежда Стелянова Стефанова and Жулиета Викторова Грудева for supporting me always when I most needed.

Along with, I am greatful for Dragão Branco Aerodesign and SAE Aerodesign Brazil Competition for embracing and feeding my mind with new ideas and skills related to aeronautics as well as the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) for the great education and academic experience.

And last, but not least nor less special, my family whom raised me and believed in my potential during all my life.
